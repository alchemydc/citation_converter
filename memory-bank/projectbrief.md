# Project Brief

## Overview
Successfully built and completed a Python script that processes scientific citations by finding their PubMed IDs (PMIDs) and creates a markdown file with decorated citations and clickable links.

## Implemented Features
- Reads citations from input file, preserving citation numbers
- Uses PubMed E-utilities API to find PMIDs based on author, title, and journal matching
- Creates markdown-formatted output with clickable PubMed links
- Shows progress bar during processing
- Handles cases where PMIDs aren't found gracefully
- Cross-platform support with automated setup scripts

## Technical Implementation
- Python script using built-in libraries and minimal dependencies
- Uses pubmed-id library for API interaction
- Environment variables for configuration
- Automated setup with virtual environment and dependency management
- Sample data included for testing and demonstration

## Achievements
- Single unified script handling all functionality
- Clean markdown output format
- Robust error handling
- User-friendly setup process
- Progress visualization during processing
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Target Users
Technical sysadmins and researchers who need to:
- Automate citation processing
- Add PubMed references to citations
- Generate markdown-formatted citation lists
- Create clickable PubMed links

## Final State
Project completed with all planned functionality implemented and tested. Ready for use with comprehensive documentation and automated setup process.
